After you create a course, you can access information about it from the Instructor Dashboard. 

To view course data:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Click **Instructor** then **Try New Beta Dashboard**.

#. Click **Course Info** if necessary. 

   The Basic Course Information section of the page that opens lists identifying information for the course, indicates whether it has started or ended, and shows the defined grade cutoff for passing or failing.

You also use the Instructor Dashboard to set up the staff for your course, enroll students and access student data, and initiate, review, and adjust grades.
