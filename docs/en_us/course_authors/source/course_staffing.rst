Assigning discussion administration roles 
==========================================

You can designate a team of people to help you run course discussions. Different options for working with discussion posts are available to discussion administrators with these roles:

* Forum moderators can edit and delete posts, review posts flagged for misuse, close and reopen threads, pin posts and endorse responses, and, if the course is cohorted, see posts from all cohorts. Responses and comments made by moderators are marked as "Staff".

* Forum community TAs have the same options for working with discussions as moderators. Responses and comments made by community TAs are marked as "Community TA".

* Forum admins have the same options for working with discussions as moderators. Admins can also assign these discussion management roles to more people while your course is running, or remove a role from a user whenever necessary. Responses and comments made by admins are marked as "Staff".

Before you can assign roles to your discussion administrators, you need their email addresses. 

* To get the email address for a staff member, on the Instructor Dashboard click **Membership** and then select Course Staff from the drop-down list.
* To get the email address of a student, on the Instructor Dashboard click **Data Download** > **List enrolled students' profile information**.

**Tip**: These instructions are for the new Instructor Dashboard: click **Try New Beta Dashboard**.

To assign a role:

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Click **Instructor Dashboard** then **Try New Beta Dashboard**.
